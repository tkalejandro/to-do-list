# To-Do List App

An exercise to practice some of the topics we have covered so far this term.

### Description

- Create a basic "To-Do List" app!
- Through this app, the user should be able to add items to a To-Do list. 
- There should be an input field where items can be added. 
- The user should also be able to delete each item via a button.

### Instructions

1. Create a "To-Do List" app with an input field and button for adding "To-Do" items. When the button is clicked, a "To-Do" item should be added to the list of To-Do's.

2. Add a "Delete" button in the form of an "**X**" to each of your "To-Do" items, which will let user delete a "To-Do" item from the list.

3. **Optional:** Add extra styling to make the app look nicer!

### Optional Bonus
- Add a button the user can click, which will add extra styling to an item to show that it is complete. 

> **Note:** You can refer to the gif below for an idea of how your app could look:
